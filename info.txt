src-folder:
    - contains modules and packages for the project
    - the maze-solver subpackages:
        - __main__.py: makes the enclosing package runnable
            - this way you can use run it from the cl with: python -m maze-solver ....


- pyproject.toml:
    provides: project configuration, metadata, dependencies
    needs at minimum a [build-system] table specifying the build tool
    setuptools is only one possible build tool
    for more info visit: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/flow/

- role.py 
    roles for each possible squares are organized as an enum
    by extending 'IntEnum' you can make use of 'custom file format'
    by calling Enum.auto() you get each enum the numeric value in turn.
    now you can treat each enum as a number eg Role.ENEMY = 1
    roles are optional -> a null value (None) could indicate a lack of a role
    to not need to check in conditional branches for for None there is the 'Null Object Pattern':
        - Stop using None
        - use dedicated Null Object (here Role.None = 0)

- border.py 
    this is again implemented as an enum.
    this time we use enum.IntFlag which uses bit field logic
    this way you can simulate all 16 possibilities for a Border object:
        Border.TOP means one border on the north and has the value 1
        Border.TOP | Border.BOTTOM means one border north and one south and has the border.value 3 
        you can then check, if the border is of a specific type using the identity test operator 'is':
            border is Border.TOP # False
            border is Border.TOP | Border.BOTTOM # True
        alternatively you could use '==' to test against a numeric value:
            border == 3 # True
        additionally you can check teh existence of a given border by using 'in'
            Border.TOP in border # True
            Border.LEFT in border # False
